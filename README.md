A set of basic Deep Learning Algorithms for Feature Extraction / Dimensionality Reduction and Classification in the field of ASR.

Deep Learning Algorithms:
* Multilayer-Perceptron
* Autoencoders
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines
* Deep Belief Networks (Classification + Feature Extraction / Dimensionality Reduction)

Dataset:
* [Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)

The Restricted Boltzmann Machines and the Preprocessing implementations are based on this textbook:
* [Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition" published by Springer](https://github.com/SpringerNLP)
